# Computer Vision Homework Series

A collection of computer vision exercises designed to build fundamental skills before diving into deep learning. These assignments focus on traditional CV techniques using OpenCV and NumPy.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a series of homework assignments that progressively build computer vision skills essential for understanding deep learning concepts. Each task focuses on core CV fundamentals like image processing, morphological operations, contour detection, and pathfinding algorithms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental image processing techniques
- Understand morphological operations (dilation, erosion)
- Learn contour detection and analysis
- Implement pathfinding algorithms for computer vision
- Build a strong foundation for deep learning applications

## 🎓 Why This Approach?

These traditional computer vision techniques provide essential building blocks for understanding deep learning:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Understanding how to prepare data for neural networks
2. **Feature Detection**: Learning what features matter before letting networks learn them automatically
3. **Morphological Operations**: Foundation for understanding convolutional operations
4. **Coordinate Systems**: Essential for object detection and localization tasks
5. **Algorithm Thinking**: Developing intuition for how CV algorithms work before using black-box solutions

## 🔮 Future Tasks

Planned additions to this homework series:

- Edge detection and line finding
- Object detection using template matching
- Image segmentation techniques
- Feature matching and image alignment
- Optical flow and motion detection
